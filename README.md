# Approximate Matrix Multiplication over Sliding Windows

In this project, we primarily utilize dataset "apr" as an example. You can directly run "demo.m" located in the "code" folder to see the results. The "algorithms" folder mainly stores the main algorithms, while the "dataset" folder contains the datasets. We have provided dataset "apr" here, and if you need other datasets, you can download them from <https://github.com/FerreroJeremy/Cross-Language-Dataset>. The "output" folder is intended to store the results of the algorithm runs.
